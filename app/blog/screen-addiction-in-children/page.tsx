                <p>
                    If your child becomes unusually upset when screens are taken away, constantly asks for a phone or tablet,
                    or seems bored without digital stimulation, it is natural to feel worried about if your child is developing
                    Screen Addiction. Many parents today are asking the same question: Is my child just enjoying screens, or is
                    getting addicted to screens?
                </p>

                <p>
                    With screens woven into education, entertainment, and even family routines, it can be difficult to know
                    when screen use crosses a healthy limit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In simple terms, addiction refers to a pattern of behaviour that becomes hard to control despite negative
                    effects on daily life. Addictions are broadly understood as either substance related or behavioural, with
                    screen addiction falling under behavioural addiction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While it is not a formal medical diagnosis for young children, the term is commonly used to describe
                    problematic or excessive screen use that begins to interfere with emotional regulation, behaviour, sleep,
                    relationships, or daily routines.
                </p>

                    How Screen Addiction Affects the Developing Brain
                </h2>

                <p>
                    From a psychological perspective, this pattern is linked to how young brains develop. Screens provide fast
                    and frequent rewards through bright visuals, sounds, and instant feedback.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Current research suggests that repeated exposure to highly stimulating screen content can affect the
                    development of the prefrontal cortex, while increasing sensitivity in reward related areas such as the
                    striatum (Paulus et al., 2019).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some studies have also found associations between high levels of early screen exposure and a greater risk
                    of attention difficulties and ADHD-like symptoms (Madigan et al., 2019).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Emerging research has further noted links between excessive early screen exposure and Autism related
                    features, without suggesting that screens cause autism itself (Heffler et al., 2020).

                    Is Screen Addiction the Real Problem, or a Signal
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Over time, excessive screen use creates a reinforcement cycle. Screens become the quickest way to feel
                    calm, entertained, or emotionally regulated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics caution that excessive screen use
                    can displace essential developmental experiences such as free play, caregiver interaction, and sleep.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The issue is not screens themselves but when they start replacing experiences children need for healthy
                    development.

                </h2>

                <p><strong>How much screen time is too much?</strong><br />
                    Screen time becomes a concern when it interferes with sleep, play, learning, or emotional regulation.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Are educational apps better?</strong><br />
                    Content quality, adult involvement, and balance matter more than labels.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Should I stop screen time completely?</strong><br />
                    Gradual limits work better than sudden removal.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Why is my child irritable after screen time?</strong><br />
                    Fast paced digital content can overstimulate young brains.
